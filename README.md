Logic sandbox is a simple logic simulator primarily for learning purposes. Currently it is in early development, so lots of bugs, and is missing many of the features I want to add. 

Inspiration came from [simcirjs](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/simcirjs), a logic simulator that is web-based and written in HTML5 and JavaScript.
